  This paper addresses the design optimization process of an energy harvesting device for scavenging energy from an e-gadget, utilizing its "rocking" motion. The plucking mechanism inspired by the frequency up-conversion technique provides initial displacement exciting piezoelectric beams and increases the total number of excitations multiple times. The harvester is designed in conjunction with the multidimensional surrogate optimization algorithm to maximize the device’s performance considering the geometrical features of the concept and the constrained operating environment. The established numerical model is validated first using a set of experimental data. The obtained numerical results demonstrate that the developed 10.2" size device produces 55 mJ in half-period when inclined at 45°, which is equivalent to generating 0.3 W. Considering that an iPad of the same size consumes around 3 W, the proposed energy harvester is capable of extending its battery life by 10%.
